The product manager sets the tone for a product, understands the customerâ€™s pain points, leads a team, takes various forms of input, and ultimately makes the product-related decisions. With this role, you will find yourself not only handling many of the engineering aspects of a product, but also interacting with users every day to ultimately create a furnished result."/>
